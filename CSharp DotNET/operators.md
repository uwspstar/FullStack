```
“&=”(Bitwise AND Assignment) : 
This operator is combination of ‘&’ and ‘=’ operators. 
This operator first “Bitwise AND” the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right 
and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

Example :
(a &= 2) can be written as (a = a & 2)
If initially value stored in a is 6. Then (a &= 2) = 2.
