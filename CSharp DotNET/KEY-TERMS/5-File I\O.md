# File I\O
- ```File``` and ```FileInfo``` object are used to determine properties about a file and also perform operations on a file.
- A ```Stream``` is used to represent the contents of a file in memory and can be used to write data to a file or read data from a file.
- A ```BinaryReader``` and ```BinaryWriter``` are used for reading and writing ```binary values```.
- A ```StreamReader``` and ```StreamWriter``` are used for reading and writing characters by using an encoded value to convert the characters to and from bytes.
- The default character encoding for a ```StreamReader``` and ```StreamWriter``` is ```UTF-8```.
- You can use a ```StreamReader``` to read a file character by character, line by line, or the entire file at once.
- The ```StringReader``` and ```StringWriter``` is used to read and write string data.
- The ```async``` and ```await``` keywords are used to perform asynchronous operations.
- The ```async``` keyword must modify a method signature for it to use the ```await``` keyword.
- The ```await``` command kicks off the method but returns processing back to the calling method until the method completes.
