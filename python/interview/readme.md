### primitive types

```
Python has a number of build-in types: 
  - numerics (e.g., integer), 
  - sequences (e.g., list), 
  - mappings (e.g., dict), # as well as 
  - classes, 
  - instances 
  - exceptions. 
```
- All instances of these types are objects.

- sys.maxsize 
- sys.float_info.

Integers in Python3 are unbounded—the maximum integer representable is a function of the
available memory.
