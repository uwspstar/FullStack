## How Does Computer Work

![Full Stack Developer](/Img/101_computer_work.png)

- `ALU` : Arithmetic Logic Unit: ALU performs the basic logical and arithmetic operations. Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Logical operations like comparing two numbers (such as >, <, >=, <=, etc.), logical AND, OR, NOT, etc. So, ALU has performed these basic operations.
- `CU` : Control Unit: Control unit controls the other components like Input and output devices, main memory, hard disk, etc. The job of the control unit is to utilize other resources effectively.
- `Main Memory` : when computer run any program (Program Files), it will be brought into the main memory so that the CPU can execute it.
- `HDD` : A hard disk is a storage device for a computer (contains two types of files, i.e. data files and program files.)
- `INPUT` : Input devices are Keyboard, Mouse, etc.
- `OUTPUT` : Output devices are monitors, printers, etc.

## The computer only understands the binary number system

- `Binary` Number System: {0,1}
- `Octal` Number System: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
- `Decimal` Number System: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
- `Hexadecimal` Number System: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, A, B, C, D, E, F}

### How do we Convert Decimal Numbers to Binary Numbers?

## Programming Languages

- we need for a programming language in order to communicate with computers. a computer can understand only `machine code` or `binary code`.
- `Compiler` : Programs get converted by the Compiler and generate machine code. The compiler converts all these instructions into binary language or machine code.
- `interface` : The interface means without having the background details we can perform our tasks. For example, the end-user understands the English language, then the end-user clicks on English, then all the instructions will come in English language and operations will be performed.

### Types of Computer Languages

- Low-level Programming Language : at a low level, we have two languages i.e.
 `Machine Language` and `Assembly language`
  - `Machine Language` : is the fundamental language (binary of 1’s and 0’s) for the system and it can be directly understandable without any translation.
  - `Assembly language` : is a programming language (Symbolic Language) but that is a low-level programming language. The assembly language contains some human-readable commands such as mov, add, mul, div, sub, etc. (a little easier to write and understand compare with `Machine Language`. Assembly code is not faster than machine code)
- High-Level Programming Language : Examples of High-Level Languages are C, C++, Java, Python, C#, Visual Basic, Visual C++, etc.

### Types of Software

- System Software
  - Operating System: DOS, WINDOWS, LINUX, UNIX
  - System Support: Compiler, Interpreter, Assembler
  - System Development: Linker, Loader, Editor
- Application Software
  - Application-Specific: MS OFFICE, Oracle
  - General Purpose Software
