# Statements vs Expressions
### Statements
- Define actions 
- Executed for their side-effect

```
string posOrNeg;
if (value > 0)
  posOrNeg = "positive"; 
else 
  posOrNeg = "negative";

```

### Expressions
- Produce results 
- Executed for their result
```
var posOrNeg = value > 0 ? "positive" : "negative";
```
