# Arrays and collections 
- Arrays all inherit from the System.Array type.
- There are numerous collection types that are similar to arrays, but they offer much more flexibility for manipulating the data contained in the collection. ➤➤ ArrayList, HashTable, Queue, SortedList, and Stack are all in the System.Collections namespace. ➤➤ Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, List<T>, Queue<T>, SortedList<TKey, TValue>, and Stack<T> are all in the System.Collections.Generic namespace. ➤➤ The generic collection classes are used when you want all objects to be of the same type. ➤➤ Queues are first-in-first-out. ➤➤ Stacks are last-in-first-out. ➤➤ You can implement the IComparable interface to control how two objects are compared.
- A Dictionary object stores a key\value pair.
- Custom collections inherit from the CollectionBase class.
