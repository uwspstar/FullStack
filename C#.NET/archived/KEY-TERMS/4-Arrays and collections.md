# Arrays and collections 
- Arrays all inherit from the System.Array type.
- There are numerous collection types that are similar to arrays, but they offer much more flexibility for manipulating the data contained in the collection.
- ```ArrayList, HashTable, Queue, SortedList, and Stack``` are all in the ```System.Collections``` namespace.
- ```Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, List<T>, Queue<T>, SortedList<TKey, TValue>, and Stack<T>``` are all in the ```System.Collections.Generic``` namespace.
- The ```generic collection``` classes are used when you want all objects to be of the ```same type```.
- Queues are first-in-first-out.
- Stacks are last-in-first-out.
- You can implement the IComparable interface to control how two objects are compared.
- A Dictionary object stores a key\value pair.
- Custom collections inherit from the CollectionBase class.
