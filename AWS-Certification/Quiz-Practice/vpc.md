A. ensure that instances in your subnet have only private IP addresses. 
B. attach an existing datastore to a virtual machine.
C. ensure that your network access control and security group rules block the relevant traffic flowing into your instance.
D. ensure that your subnet's route table points to the Internet Gateway.
```
