# C# enum httpVerbs by chatGPT

- Here is a complete example of an HttpVerbs enum in C#:

```C#
public enum HttpVerbs
{
    GET,
    POST,
    PUT,
    DELETE,
    PATCH,
    HEAD,
    OPTIONS
}
```

- This HttpVerbs enum includes the most commonly used HTTP methods: `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, and OPTIONS.`

```C#
using System;

namespace HttpVerbsExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Use the enum value in a switch statement
            HttpVerbs verb = HttpVerbs.GET;
            switch (verb)
            {
                case HttpVerbs.GET:
                    Console.WriteLine("The verb is GET");
                    break;
                case HttpVerbs.POST:
                    Console.WriteLine("The verb is POST");
                    break;
                case HttpVerbs.PUT:
                    Console.WriteLine("The verb is PUT");
                    break;
                case HttpVerbs.DELETE:
                    Console.WriteLine("The verb is DELETE");
                    break;
                case HttpVerbs.PATCH:
                    Console.WriteLine("The verb is PATCH");
                    break;
                case HttpVerbs.HEAD:
                    Console.WriteLine("The verb is HEAD");
                    break;
                case HttpVerbs.OPTIONS:
                    Console.WriteLine("The verb is OPTIONS");
                    break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- In this example, we first define a variable verb of type HttpVerbs, and assign it the value HttpVerbs.GET. Then, we use a switch statement to determine the value of verb and output the corresponding message to the console.
