# git

- git checkout HASH 
- git reset --hard HASH
- git checkout HASH ```vs```  git reset --hard HASH
  
  ```
  The main difference between them is that 
  checkout is generally safer as it won’t overwrite local changes in the working directory. 
  Furthermore it won’t alter the current branch you are into.
