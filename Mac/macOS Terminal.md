### To customize your macOS Terminal with a dark background and green text, follow these steps:

### 1. Open Terminal
- Open the Terminal app on your Mac. You can find it in **Applications > Utilities** or use Spotlight search (`Cmd + Space`) and type "Terminal."

### 2. Open Terminal Preferences
- Go to the **Terminal** menu at the top of your screen and select **Settings...** (or press `Cmd + ,`).

### 3. Select a Profile
- In the **Profiles** tab, you’ll see a list of available profiles on the left side. You can choose any profile as a base, but let's start with the **Basic** profile.

### 4. Customize the Profile
- Select the profile you want to customize, then click on the **Text** tab.

### 5. Change the Text Color
- In the **Text** section, click on the color box next to **Text**. A color picker will appear.
- Choose a **green** color for the text. You can pick a specific shade by using the RGB sliders or HEX color codes (e.g., `#00FF00` for bright green).

### 6. Change the Background Color
- Still in the **Text** section, click on the color box next to **Background**.
- Choose a **dark** color for the background, such as black or dark gray. Again, you can use RGB sliders or HEX codes (e.g., `#000000` for black).

### 7. Save the Profile
- Once you’re satisfied with the colors, you can close the settings window. The changes should apply immediately.
- If you want this profile to be your default, click the **Default** button below the profile list.

### 8. Optional: Increase Font Size
- If you want to increase the visibility, you might also consider adjusting the **Font** size in the same **Text** tab.

Now, your Terminal should have a dark background with green text!
