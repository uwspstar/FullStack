# events
- Events have ```publishers``` and ```subscribers```. A given event may have many subscribers or no subscribers.
- Use a delegate type to define an event, as in the following code:
```
public delegate void OverdrawnEventHandler(); 
public event OverdrawnEventHandler Overdrawn;
```
- You can use the predefined Action delegate type to define events, as in the following code:
```
public event Action Overdrawn;
```
-  Microsoft best practice: Make the eventâ€™s first parameter a sender object and the second an object that gives more information about the event. Derive the type of the object from the ```EventArgs``` class, and end its name with Args as in ```OverdrawnEventArgs```.
- You can use the predefined EventHandler delegate type to define an event that takes an object named sender as a first parameter and an event data object as a second parameter, as shown in the following code:
```
public event EventHandler<OverdrawnEventArgs> Overdrawn;
```
- Raise an event, as in the following code:
```
if (EventName != null) 
  EventName(arguments...);
```
- Classes cannot inherit events. To make it possible for derived classes to raise base class events, give the base class an OnEventName method that raises the event.
- A program can use += and -= to subscribe and unsubscribe from events.
- If a program subscribes to an event more than once, the event handler is called multiple times.
- If a program unsubscribes from an event more times than it was subscribed, nothing bad happens.
