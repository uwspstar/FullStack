## primitive types

```py
Python has a number of build-in types: 
  - numerics (e.g., integer), 
  - sequences (e.g., list), 
  - mappings (e.g., dict), # as well as 
  - classes, 
  - instances 
  - exceptions. 
```

- All instances of these types are objects.

- sys.maxsize
- sys.float_info.

```py
2**63 - 1 on a 64-bit machine

Integers in Python3 are unboundedâ€”the maximum integer representable is a function of the
available memory. 
```

- XOR
