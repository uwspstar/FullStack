### SOLID Introduction
- http://csharp-video-tutorials.blogspot.com/2017/11/solid-design-principles-introduction.html
- SOLID principles are the design principles that enable us manage most of the software design problems
- The term SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable
- The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by Robert C. Martin
- The SOLID acronym was first introduced by Michael Feathers

### Single Responsibility Principle

### Liskov Substitution Principle
- Introduced by Barbara Liskov state that “objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their sub-types without altering the correctness of that program”
If a program module is using a Base class, then the reference to the Base class can be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the functionality of the program module
- We can also state that Derived types must be substitutable for their base types
### Open/Closed Principle
### Interface Segregation Principle
### Dependency Inversion Principle
