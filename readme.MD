# A parity bit (error detecting code)
```
A parity bit, or check bit, is a bit added to a string of binary code to ensure 
that the total number of 1-bits in the string is even or odd[1]. 
Parity bits are used as the simplest form of error detecting code.

There are two variants of parity bits: even parity bit and odd parity bit.

In the case of even parity, 
for a given set of bits, the occurrences of bits whose value is 1 is counted. 
If that count is odd, the parity bit value is set to 1, 
making the total count of occurrences of 1s in the whole set (including the parity bit) an even number.

### REST & RESTful API
```
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style 
that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. 
Web services that conform to the REST architectural style, 
called RESTful Web services (RWS), provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.
